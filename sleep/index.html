        <h3>What this is for!</h3>
        <div class="about">
            <p>This is so I can try to predict what time you all will go to sleep based on environmental factors. Also to maybe predict why some of you cannot sleep. <i>*cough* Payton *cough*</i>
            <br><br>
            I am hoping I will be able to do this using the same methods as my face recognition machine learning project (maybe not so from scratch this time though). That is, it will mainly use Principle Component Analysis and an algorithm such as K-Nearest Neighbor to make predictions to determine causes for irregular sleep patterns. 
            <br><br>
            In the end, it is just a project that will end up on my portfolio. If it is good at what it does, I may even use it for my thesis paper or something. 
            <br><br>
            </p>
            <p>These are the factors I will be measuring via the forms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Day of the week</li>
                <li>How much homework you had that day</li>
                <li>Diet i.e. How much alcohol or redbull drank (Looking at you Reed & Payton)</li>
                <li>Stress level</li>
                <li>Time spent on computer (Grace ü§®) </li>
                <li>Time spent on phone</li>
                <li>Exercise</li>
                <li>Mood before bed</li>
                <li>Naps</li>
                <li>Health i.e. Are you sick or not?</li>
                <li>Maybe a few other things idk yet</li>
            </ul>
